**[SympluR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SympluR)** is an [R](https://www.r-project.org) package for analyzing data from the Healthcare Social Graph via access to the [Symplur API](https://www.symplur.com/product/symplur-api/).

#### Healthcare Social Graph

The Symplur API gives access to insights from the [Healthcare Social Graph®](https://www.symplur.com/technology/healthcare-social-graph/) – the vast neural network of public healthcare communities, conversations and people, hand curated by Symplur and powered by machine learning.

#### #hcsmR

Take a look at the over [200 published journal articles](https://www.symplur.com/healthcare-social-media-research/) that have employed or referenced Symplur data in their research. #hcsmR is a collaboration between Symplur and Stanford Medicine X.

## Get started

Install R package from CRAN:

```
install.packages("SympluR")
library(SympluR)
```

For latest development version, install the package from GitHub:

```
library("devtools")
install_github('symplur/SympluR')
library(SympluR)
```

## Symplur API Credentials

To make use of this R package you need to have access to the Symplur API. The package comes with free demo credentials that allow you to access the demo dataset `#LCSMDemoData`. This dataset is a 4-week snapshot of the conversations from [#LCSM](https://www.symplur.com/healthcare-hashtags/lcsm/) (Lung Cancer Social Media) from 08/16/2017 to 09/15/2017.

_You can get a quick look at the data now by opening the same demo dataset in [Symplur Signals Dashboards](https://dashboard.symplur.com/hashtag/LCSMDemoData?start=1504249200&end=1505458799) with a free account._

To access any other datasets, please [contact Symplur](https://www.symplur.com/contact/) for further details.

The R package will prompt you for your credentials during the first API call in your R session. Paste in your credentials when asked, or if you want to try out the demo data then hit enter without entering anything.

## Documentation

Find the documentation in R for each function in this package. Example:

`?symplurTweetsSummary`

`?symplurTweetsActivity`

`?symplurPeopleInfluencers`

`?symplurContentRetweets`

`?symplurContentWords`

To learn more about each Symplur API endpoint used in this package and the accepted parameters please see the [Symplur API Documentation](https://api.symplur.com/v1/docs).

## Example Usage

### Summary

The `symplurTweetsSummary()` function will create a list with statistics of the database and the time span selected. The stats includes tweets, mentions, impressions, users, retweets, replies, urls_shared, etc.

`LCSM <- symplurTweetsSummary("09/01/2017", "09/08/2017", databases = "#LCSMDemoData")`

### Summary Table

The `symplurTweetsSummaryTable()` function will create a data frame with summary statistics of all databases and time spans defined in an existing data frame.
First create in a spreadsheet columns 'database', 'start' and 'end'. Add rows according to your query needs, then export as a CSV-file. See [example CSV-file](https://github.com/symplur/SympluR/blob/master/inst/extdata/datasets.csv).

_Example table:_

| database      | start      | end        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| #LCSMDemoData | 09/01/2017 | 09/06/2017 |
| #LCSMDemoData | 09/06/2017 | 09/13/2017 |
| #LCSMDemoData | 09/13/2017 | 09/19/2017 |

Load such an CSV-file into R as a data frame:

```
library(readr)
LCSMquery <- read_csv(file.choose())
```

Now we're ready to run the analysis:

`LCSManalysis <- symplurTweetsSummaryTable(LCSMquery)`

You can also try out `symplurTweetsSummaryTable()` with an example CSV file:

```
library(readr)
datasets <- read_csv(system.file("extdata", "datasets.csv", package = "SympluR", mustWork = TRUE))
LCSMDemoDataTweetsSummaryTable <- symplurTweetsSummaryTable(datasets)
```
